A virtual assistant for general tech support (in progress).

I'm usiing this repo to learn RASA and virtual assistants more generally.

## Initial Functionality

The inital functionality will be providing the correct *Getting Started* link based on the users operating system. The assistant should be able to handle chitchat, and ask the user what operating system they are using. Given this information, it should provide the correct URL, either to the Windows Getting Started page, or the MacOS Getting Started page.

## Future State - Goal

In the future, I'm hoping to generalize the assistant to provide in text answers based on the users questions, and fall back to providing search results to the users question.
