66,"Regarding the new servicing model for Windows 10, will Enterprise customers be required to adopt the rapid release cadence too?","No, Enterprise customers will continue to service and manage their Windows 10 clients the same way they do today. Here is what Terry Myerson had to say:  We understand that businesses require choice in how updates are delivered, and at what pace. So as I discussed on September 30th, with Windows 10, businesses will be able to pick the speed of innovation that is right for each   group of their users, rather than rely on a one size fits all solution.  Business customers will be able to opt-in to the fast-moving consumer update pace, or lock-down mission critical environments to receive only security and critical updates to their systems. And businesses will have an additional   option for systems that aren’t mission critical, but need to keep pace with the latest innovations while having the benefit to install updates after they have been tested in the broad market. And the choice isn’t one or the other for businesses; we expect   that most corporations will require a mix of these options to accommodate their business scenarios. Take for example an investment bank, where mission critical systems on the trading floor receive only security updates, whereas mobile devices for financial   advisors are kept up to date with the latest feature innovations – enabling the appropriate pace of updates for each device.

If the answer to any of these problems is no I don't think I will be continuing with windows products.  After the frustrations I have encountered with windows 8.1, I was on the verge of ditching the whole system to try out Apple products until a friend mentioned   that they are about to release Windows 10.  So, one more chance to get it right Microsoft people.  I am looking forward to an upgrade away from 8.1  forever!! 2 people found this comment helpful Was this comment helpful?

Just wait, a driver ought to be released - by the company or in a Windows 10 update version.   No specific driver released for Windows 7 or 8 even released for my old HP printer.  In Windows 10 I can use it to print, installing nothing, using a driver for the HP series detected by Windows 10.   However it fails to provide all the options - SOLVED rather easily:  I  installed my favorite ArcSoft image processing program (for XP) into Windows 10 and printed using that no problem at all.  Note that program wouldn't install in Windows 7.  However an even older printer  - no luck in Windows 7-8-10,  only XP actually prints. 7 people found this comment helpful Was this comment helpful?  Yes No Sorry this didn't help. Great!

77,Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10 Preview?,"Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.   Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.   So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.  If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.  Where can I get more information about preparing my computer safely for testing Windows 10? Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making significant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is  strongly recommended!

When the build reaches the license expiration date, the system will automatically reboot every three hours.  Approximately 2 weeks after the license expires, the build will no longer boot at all.  If you are still on an older build and are getting expiration warnings, it is likely that Windows Update is failing to install the latest build automatically.  To resolve the problem, download the latest ISO file from  http://windows.microsoft.com/preview-iso-update.  After the download is complete, double-click the ISO file to mount   it and then launch setup.exe.  If Windows has stopped booting due to an expired license, to resolve the issue you’ll need to  download the ISO file from another computer and then transfer the ISO file to installation media such   as a USB flash drive or DVD.   Then boot the PC from the installation media to install the latest build of Tech Preview.
