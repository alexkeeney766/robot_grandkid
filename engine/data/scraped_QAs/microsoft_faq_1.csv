0,What is Windows 10?,"Windows 10 is the name for Microsoft's next generation client operating system.
 
"
1,What happened to Windows 9?,"There was never a Windows 9, Microsoft skipped this number and went to 10 instead. Company officials decided to choose 10 because they believe this release is a 'Perfect 10' and to also signify this is the last major release of Windows. There will
 still be revisions of Windows 10 called Feature Updates, just don't expect there to be a Windows 11, Windows 12 etc. Initially revealed at BUILD 2014 as a minor update called ‘Threshold’, Windows 10 was originally intended be a minor Update 2 for Windows 8.1.
 Somewhere along the way, plans changed and the operating system evolved into the major revision we have today. 
 When will Windows 10 officially become available?  Microsoft launched Windows 10 world wide on July 29th 2015 at 12 AM EST. This is what Microsoft Program Manager for Windows, Terry Myerson had to say: 
 We continue to make great development progress and shared today that Windows 10 will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages.

Of course, with significant changes in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor to find out about support for Windows
 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.

"
46,Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?,"Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows Terry Myerson described it: 
 This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
– at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
– in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet. 
 And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking ""What version are you on?"" will cease to make sense
– which is great news for our Windows developers.

 Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free.  
"
47,What does lifetime of the device mean?,"The logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and 5 years extended support. 
"
48,What are the official upgrade paths to Windows 10?,"Microsoft revealed in a Channel 9 Video the official upgrade paths to Windows 10: 
  
 Windows XP, Windows Vista and LINUX users will have to purchase a full retail license and perform a clean install from a .ISO, Windows 8.0 users can use the .ISO file to perform an in place upgrade.

49,"When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?","If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too. 
 If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version. If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version. 
 Full version (Retail): - Includes transfer rights to another computer. - Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows. - Expensive 
 Upgrade version (Retail): 
 - Includes transfer rights to another computer. - require a previous qualifying version of Windows. - Expensive, but cheaper than full version 
 OEM : OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following: - OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel - OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on - OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard - OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system 
"
50,What happens if I change my motherboard?,"As it pertains to the OEM license this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
 
 From the Windows 10 end user license agreement: b. Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices. 
"
51,I am on a slow connection or I don't have access to the Internet. Is there an option to request backup media?,"Microsoft says: ""We’ll have options available for users who can’t download through Windows Update."" These options have yet to be announced.

52,Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?,"Microsoft recently noted the following options available:  With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state. Source:

53,"Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?","By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.

 When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
 
 Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
 So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
 If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' 
 Will ISO media be provided for the final release?  Yes, you will be able to download ISO media for Windows 10 RTM.  Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition of Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license
 for Windows 10 Pro or go back to Windows 7 Home Premium and upgrade to Windows 10 Home.

 With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates as soon as they are available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
 
 Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:

65,Can I schedule when Windows Updates are installed and will these required updates force restart my computer?,"You can schedule when Updates are installed and no, updates do not force restart your computer. 
  Open the Notification icon from the Notification Area and click Don't forget: a restart is scheduled... 
"
66,"Regarding the new servicing model for Windows 10, will Enterprise customers be required to adopt the rapid release cadence too?","No, Enterprise customers will continue to service and manage their Windows 10 clients the same way they do today. Here is what Terry Myerson had to say: 
 We understand that businesses require choice in how updates are delivered, and at what pace. So as I discussed on September 30th, with Windows 10, businesses will be able to pick the speed of innovation that is right for each
 group of their users, rather than rely on a one size fits all solution. 
 Business customers will be able to opt-in to the fast-moving consumer update pace, or lock-down mission critical environments to receive only security and critical updates to their systems. And businesses will have an additional
 option for systems that aren’t mission critical, but need to keep pace with the latest innovations while having the benefit to install updates after they have been tested in the broad market. And the choice isn’t one or the other for businesses; we expect
 that most corporations will require a mix of these options to accommodate their business scenarios. Take for example an investment bank, where mission critical systems on the trading floor receive only security updates, whereas mobile devices for financial
 advisors are kept up to date with the latest feature innovations – enabling the appropriate pace of updates for each device.

 Will non-genuine Windows licenses qualify for the Windows 10 upgrade?
 The simple answer is no. This is what Terry Mason had to say: 
 Microsoft and our OEM partners know that many consumers are unwitting victims of piracy, and with Windows 10, we would like all of our customers to move forward with us together. While our free offer to upgrade to Windows 10 will not apply to Non-Genuine
 Windows devices, and as we’ve always done, we will continue to offer Windows 10 to customers running devices in a Non-Genuine state. In addition, in partnership with some of our valued OEM partners, we are planning very attractive Windows 10 upgrade offers
 for their customers running one of their older devices in a Non-Genuine state. Please stay tuned to learn more from our partners on the specifics of their offers.

 Does Windows 10 support syncing across USB cable / WiFi hotspot or only through OneDrive?  [So that Outlook Calendar & Contacts can be sent to a tablet without having to use my internet data allowance?]

 Thanks for that additional [disappointing] info.  
 If Windows 10 had introduced local [USB, hotspot] syncing I could consider Windows tablets & phones in the future. I quite like the idea of having the same OS on everything.  
 Without local syncing in Windows 10, I'll stick to Android tablets & phones with
MyPhoneExplorer for local syncing of MS Outlook Calendar-Contacts-Notes & general files.

Thanks for your feedback. Many thanks for the article! Vainly tried to find an answer on Internet on the following question: 
 way back, early 2013, for a limited period of time one could purchase an upgrade from Windows 7->Windows 8. at the same time, one could additionally order the Windows 8 DVD (at € 15, or so) 
 I assume this will also be the case once Windows 10 will be released. 
 The upgrade is free (for Windows 7/8 users), but presumably the DVD go at actual costs, same as with Windows 8. 
"
71,Q: will the  DVD-upgrade-version in fact be a 'full' package?,"(either OEM or Retail) 
 Meaning to say that once upgrade of version 10 is being installed on a -clean- HDD formatted pc,
 the setup will require both the Windows 10 key, then notice it is an upgrade, and subsequently ask
 for either the Windows 7 or Windows 8 key (OEM or retail). 
 This way it is not necessary to first install 7 or 8 and then install v10 over it. 
 I know Adobe follows this method: each upgrade basically is a full package, the key determines if
 it is an upgrade and the key of a previous version should additionally be entered. 
 Note:  I am using full retail versions only, i.e. sofar I have never installed a Windows upgrade,
 so I wouldn't know this is already common practice with Microsoft products.

 I assume this will also be the case once Windows 10 will be released. No, it will be free for everyone to upgrade to within the first year, so if you purchase a laptop even 3 months before Windows 10 is launched, you are going to get it anyway.
 
 The upgrade is free (for Windows 7/8 users), but presumably the DVD go at actual costs, same as with Windows 8. Well, Microsoft has a create refresh/reset media for Windows 8.1, so I assume the same for Windows 10. 
"
72,Q: will the  DVD-upgrade-version in fact be a 'full' package?,"(either OEM or Retail) Most likely, with the release of Windows 8.1, Microsoft made retail packaged versions full licenses.
 
 Meaning to say that once upgrade of version 10 is being installed on a -clean- HDD formatted pc,
 the setup will require both the Windows 10 key, then notice it is an upgrade, and subsequently ask
 for either the Windows 7 or Windows 8 key (OEM or retail). We don't know all the details, you will have a year to find out and make a decision when Windows 10 is launched.

Thanks for your feedback. Thanks for the information in the article.  One thing that was not answered is the question of which most concerns me.  Will the Windows 10 upgrade fix the multiple problems I have encountered with Windows 8.1?   These problems include but is not limited
 to the following:   1)  Constant freezing and shut down of Excel while working with the product.  Message - ""Microsoft Excel has stopped working""  2) Attachments not appearing in my e-mail.   3) After upgrading from windows 8 to 8.1 several programs stopped
 working correctly such as scanning from my printer. 
 If the answer to any of these problems is no I don't think I will be continuing with windows products.  After the frustrations I have encountered with windows 8.1, I was on the verge of ditching the whole system to try out Apple products until a friend mentioned
 that they are about to release Windows 10.  So, one more chance to get it right Microsoft people.  I am looking forward to an upgrade away from 8.1
forever!!

Just wait, a driver ought to be released - by the company or in a Windows 10 update version.

No specific driver released for Windows 7 or 8 even released for my old HP printer.
In Windows 10 I can use it to print, installing nothing, using a driver for the HP series detected by Windows 10.   However it fails to provide all the options - SOLVED rather easily:
I  installed my favorite ArcSoft image processing program (for XP) into Windows 10 and printed using that no problem at all.  Note that program wouldn't install in Windows 7.
 
 However an even older printer  - no luck in Windows 7-8-10,  only XP actually prints.
