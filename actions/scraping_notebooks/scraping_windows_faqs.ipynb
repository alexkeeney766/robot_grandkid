To date, Windows 7 introduced the most editions (Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, Enterprise, Embedded). Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions. The capability is determined specifically by how much memory your computer is able to address. The more memory, the more programs you can run and the more tasks you can complete at the same time. In this article, we take a look at Windows 10's stock keeping units (editions), architectures and build numbers. Windows 10 is considered to be the last major release of the operating system brand. Microsoft will be moving to a more service oriented model, delivering smaller pockets of features over time when they are ready.

Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance.

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

To date, Windows 7 introduced the most editions (Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, Enterprise, Embedded). Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions. The capability is determined specifically by how much memory your computer is able to address. The more memory, the more programs you can run and the more tasks you can complete at the same time. In this article, we take a look at Windows 10's stock keeping units (editions), architectures and build numbers. Windows 10 is considered to be the last major release of the operating system brand. Microsoft will be moving to a more service oriented model, delivering smaller pockets of features over time when they are ready.
